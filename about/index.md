<p align="center">I am a <b>web and mobile app developer</b> located in Denver, Colorado.</p>

## Why web and mobile development?

* I love to build and create in fun and meaningful ways
* I love to solve hard problems
* I love to learn

## What do you know?

Since I discovered a passion for building things with code almost three years ago, I have gained a firm self-taught knowledge in front-end web and mobile technologies (HTML/CSS/JavaScript, jQuery, SASS, React, ReactNative, Native Android) along with practical self-taught skills in python scripting.

The python scripting quickly went from fun to useful when I realized I could write code to do tedious tasks for me like extracting, processing, and reporting information from the large databases I was working with. A simple task that would typically take me 20 minutes each day could now be done in 3 seconds! More time to focus on fun things (like writing more scripts to do boring stuff).

## What are you learning right now?

I am always learning something. I am currently focusing on building full stack web application with the MAMP stack. And since I can never seem to just focus on one thing at a time, I am also continuing to work on personal mobile apps with React Native.

## What else do you like to do?
I have the privilege of living in a place where world-class outdoor activities are almost literally in my backyard. I love to hike, camp and backpack. And we brew great beer and coffee here. I also like to travel other places to do these things (ask me about my recent trip to the Tetons, or Big Bend, or DC, or Glacier...)

## How can I contact you?
If you want to work with me or just chat, please send me an email at ryan.d.elliott@gmail.com.
You can also find me on LinkedIn, Instagram, Github, Facebook, twitter
